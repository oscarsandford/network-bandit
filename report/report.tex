% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\section{Introduction}
Introduction here. Problem, how we got here, what the general idea is.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Related Work}

Example of related work section.

\cite{kool2018attention} and \cite{vaswani2017attention} push forward the idea of~\cite{bello2016neural} and 
employ graph attention network that incorporates both the graph topology and input features as opposed to the previous architecture 
that employed a graph-agnostic sequence to sequence mapping. ... Experimental results also 
show that this model brings benefits over the pointer network in~\cite{bello2016neural}.

\section{Framework}

Explain the technical bits.

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{k-step Q-learning}
   \label{alg:alg1}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} number of episodes $Z$, and replay batch $B$
   \STATE {\bfseries Output:} $\Theta$
   \STATE Initialize experience replay memory $M$ to capacity $N$
   \STATE Initialize agent network parameters $\Theta$
   \FOR{episode = 1 {\bfseries to} Z}
   \STATE $g \sim$ SampleGraph($G$)
   \STATE $s \sim$ SampleSolution($S$)
   \FOR{i = 1 {\bfseries to} m}
   \STATE Compute the context vector $c_i$
   \STATE $a_i=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
                \text{random host} & w.p. \hspace{5pt} \epsilon \\
                argmax \hspace{2pt} Q(c_i;\Theta) & \text{otherwise}\\
                \end{array}
                \right.$
   \IF{$i \geq k$}
   \STATE Add tuple $(c_{i-k}, a_{i-k}, r_{i-k:i}, c_i)$ to $M$
   \ENDIF
   \STATE Sample rand batch from replay memory $B \overset{i.i.d}{\sim} M$
   \STATE Update $\Theta$ by Adam given the average loss over $B$
   \ENDFOR
   \ENDFOR
